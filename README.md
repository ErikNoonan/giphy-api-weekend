# Your Favorite GIFs


This application connects to the Giphy API. It shows a random gif upon page load, allows the user to search for specific gifs (returning the top 25 gifs from Giphy that match the search terms), and allows the user to save Gifs they like with an added comment (This info is saved in a database). The app has a separate linked view which displays the favorited Gifs and allows the user to update their comments on them.
